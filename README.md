AI-Based Strategy for Predicting Structure-Property Relationship in Polymer-Based Materials
Objective
Our objective is to formulate an AI-based strategy and develop ultra-large synthetic datasets to predict the structure-property relationship in polymer-based materials (such as adhesives). This will enable the identification of crucial raw materials and key compositions for achieving specific target properties.

Overview
Traditional Approach Limitations
The traditional trial-and-error synthesis method in polymer-based material development is time, resource, and cost-intensive. This approach may not always yield materials with the desired properties for specific applications.

Complexity in Design
Designing polymer-based materials is challenging due to the numerous variables influencing structure-property relationships. The combinations of these variables often do not have a linear relationship, resulting in a wide range of material properties.

Potential of Machine Learning (ML)
ML methods offer a promising alternative to trial-and-error synthesis by predicting critical material features relevant to specific applications, thereby expediting material design.

Data Challenges
There is a limited availability of large datasets for polymer-based materials due to the high costs associated with their construction.

Approach to Project
Solving the Problem Using Machine Learning / Deep Learning
Approach Overview:

Employ traditional data science techniques to split datasets for ML model training and testing.
Focus on using supervised regression algorithms to predict the desired properties.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Train models on a subset of the dataset and evaluate their performance on the remaining samples.
Interpreting Model Results:

Analyze feature importance to understand the influence of raw materials on cohesive strength predictions.
Integrate ML with molecular dynamics simulations to optimize polymer formulations for specific properties, such as adhesion strength.
Visualization of Project Integration
In the broader context, the project can be visualized as a cohesive integration of various segments, combining traditional data science techniques with innovative ML and molecular dynamics simulation methods to enhance polymer material design.

Project Status
This project is currently ongoing, and further updates will be provided as new developments and results are achieved.
